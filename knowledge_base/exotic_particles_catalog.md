# Catalog of Exotic Particles & High-Energy Resonances (2026 Edition)

## 1. Introduction: How to Use This Catalog
This knowledge base describes hypothetical particles predicted by Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories.
**For the Orchestrator:** When the Analyst reports an anomaly at a specific mass (e.g., 3.5 TeV) with specific substructure features (e.g., 2-prong jets), compare those findings against the "Signatures" listed below to formulate a hypothesis (e.g., *"The 3.5 TeV bump matches the signature of a Z' boson decaying to top quarks"*).

## 2. Heavy Gauge Bosons (Z', W')

### A. Z-Prime ($Z'$) Boson
* **Theory:** Many Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and String Theories predict extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetries, implying a heavy neutral partner to the standard $Z$ boson.
* **Search Region (Mass):**
    * **Excluded:** $< 4.5 \text{ TeV}$ (for Standard Model couplings).
    * **High Priority Search:** $4.5 \text{ TeV} - 6.0 \text{ TeV}$.
    * **Leptophobic Models:** If the $Z'$ does not couple to leptons, it could exist at lower masses ($2.0 - 4.0 \text{ TeV}$) hidden under the QCD background.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **Dijet ($q\bar{q}$):** High rate, but huge background.
    * **Ditop ($t\bar{t}$):** **Primary Target for LaCATHODE.**
        * **Substructure:** The resulting Top jets will be highly boosted. Look for **Low $\tau_{32}$** (3-prong structure) inside the large-radius jet.
* **Anomaly Profile:** Narrow resonance (width $\Gamma/M \approx 3\%$).

### B. W-Prime ($W'$) Boson
* **Theory:** Predicted by Left-Right Symmetric Models ($SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$).
* **Search Region (Mass):** $3.0 \text{ TeV} - 6.0 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$tb$ (Top-Bottom):** Decays into one Top quark and one Bottom quark.
    * **Substructure:** One jet will be "fat" with 3-prong structure (Top), the other will be narrow (Bottom).
* **Anomaly Profile:** Look for asymmetry in the jet masses (Jet 1 mass $\approx 173$ GeV, Jet 2 mass $\approx$ light).

## 3. Extra Dimensions (Gravitons & Radions)

### A. Randall-Sundrum (RS) Graviton ($G_{KK}$)
* **Theory:** Warped Extra Dimensions predict "Kaluza-Klein" excitations of the graviton that can travel into our 3D brane.
* **Search Region (Mass):**
    * **Bulk Graviton:** $2.0 \text{ TeV} - 4.5 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$WW / ZZ$:** The Graviton couples strongly to longitudinal gauge bosons.
    * **Substructure:**
        * **2-Prong Jets:** Decays to $WW$ or $ZZ$ where the bosons are boosted.
        * **Metric:** Look for **Low $\tau_{21}$** (N-subjettiness ratio $\approx 0.3 - 0.4$) in **BOTH** jets. This is the "smoking gun" signature.
* **Anomaly Profile:** Broad resonance (width depends on the warping factor $\tilde{k}$).

### B. Radion ($\phi$)
* **Theory:** The field responsible for stabilizing the size of the extra dimension.
* **Search Region (Mass):** $1.0 \text{ TeV} - 3.5 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$hh$ (Di-Higgs):** Dominant decay mode.
    * **Substructure:** Each jet is a boosted Higgs boson decaying to $b\bar{b}$.
    * **Metric:** Look for **Double b-tags** inside the large-radius jet.

## 4. Compositeness (Excited Quarks)

### A. Excited Quark ($q^*$)
* **Theory:** If quarks are not fundamental but made of smaller "preons," they should have excited states (like atoms).
* **Search Region (Mass):** $4.0 \text{ TeV} - 7.0 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$qg$ (Quark-Gluon):** Decays back to a ground-state quark by emitting a gluon.
    * **Substructure:**
        * **Jet 1:** Quark-like (narrower, lower charged particle multiplicity).
        * **Jet 2:** Gluon-like (wider, higher multiplicity).
    * **Metric:** Hard to distinguish from QCD background using substructure alone. Relies heavily on the **Excess Factor** (massive bump).
* **Anomaly Profile:** Extremely wide resonance due to strong coupling decay.

---

## 5. Leptoquarks (LQ)

### A. Scalar Leptoquark
* **Theory:** Bosons that allow transitions between Quarks and Leptons (unifying matter generations).
* **Search Region (Mass):** $1.5 \text{ TeV} - 3.0 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$t\tau$ (Top-Tau) or $b\tau$:** Third-generation LQs are most popular to explain B-physics anomalies.
    * **Substructure:** One side is a hadronic Top/Bottom jet. The other side might contain a high-energy Tau lepton (very narrow, 1-prong, low particle count).
* **Anomaly Profile:** Look for events where one jet has standard hadronic features and the other is unusually narrow/isolated.

## 6. Vector-Like Quarks (VLQ)

### A. Vector-Like Top ($T$)
* **Theory:** Heavy quarks whose left- and right-handed components transform the same way under electroweak symmetry. They solve the Hierarchy Problem.
* **Search Region (Mass):** $1.2 \text{ TeV} - 2.5 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **$T \to Ht$:** Top + Higgs.
    * **$T \to Zt$:** Top + Z boson.
    * **$T \to Wb$:** Bottom + W boson.
* **Anomaly Profile:** Complex final states. Usually Pair-Produced ($T\bar{T}$), resulting in 4-6 jets. If LaCATHODE runs in dijet mode, it might catch the boosted decay products merging into two fat jets.

---

## 7. Dark Matter Mediators

### A. Axial-Vector Mediator ($Z_{DM}$)
* **Theory:** A particle that connects the Standard Model to the Dark Sector.
* **Search Region (Mass):** $1.0 \text{ TeV} - 3.5 \text{ TeV}$.
* **Decay Signature:**
    * **Dijet:** Can decay back into quarks.
    * **Mono-Jet:** If one side decays to Dark Matter (invisible), you get "Missing Energy." LaCATHODE (Dijet mode) is sensitive to the visible decay case.
* **Anomaly Profile:** Usually broad and difficult to distinguish from $Z'$.
